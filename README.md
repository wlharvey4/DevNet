Learning how to create literate documents using Emacs' Org-Mode.  Org-Mode has built-in support for literate programming,
and far more advanced editing capabilities than Texinfo, as well as all of the many other advantages given by Org-Mode
besides literate programming.  However, it seems to be a little cumbersome to try to emulate Texinfo's capabilities, so
some re-learning is going to be necessary to become proficient and use it to its advantages.  This is my first attempt at
creating something using Org-Mode, so it is very rough.
